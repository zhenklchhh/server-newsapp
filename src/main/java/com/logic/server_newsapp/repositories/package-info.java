/**
 * Package containing the data access interfaces for the application.
 *
 * <p>
 *   This package defines the repository interfaces
 *   that abstract data access operations.
 *   These interfaces are typically used with Spring Data JPA to provide
 *   methods for interacting with the database. Key components include:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li><em>UserRepository</em>: An interface for
 *     data access operations related to users.</li>
 *     <li><em>NewsRepository</em>: An interface for
 *     data access operations related to news.</li>
 *      <li><em>CommunityRepository</em>: An interface for
 *      data access operations related to communities.</li>
 *      <li><em>CommentsRepository</em>: An interface for
 *      data access operations related to comments.</li>
 *     <li><em>Other Repository Interfaces:</em> If you
 *     have other repository interfaces, document them using
 *        the same format.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   These interfaces typically extend
 *   Spring Data JPA's {@code JpaRepository} interface,
 *  providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
 *  operations for the associated entity.
 *  Custom methods can be added to these interfaces
 *  to support more specific queries or data
 *  access requirements.
 * </p>
