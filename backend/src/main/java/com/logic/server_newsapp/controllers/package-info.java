/**
 * Package containing REST controllers for the application.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package provides classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests
 * and returning appropriate responses. The controllers act as the entry points
 * for the API, interacting with the service layer to fulfill requests.
 * Key components include:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li><em>SpecificControllerName</em>:
 *          Each controller in this package typically represents a specific
 *          resource or entity in the application and includes the mappings
 *          needed to handle RESTful interactions with that resource.</li>
 *      <li><em>AnotherSpecificControllerName</em>:
 *        Controller for another entity or resource in the application.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Controllers are typically annotated with
 *   Spring's {@code @RestController} annotation.
 * </p>
