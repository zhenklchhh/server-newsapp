/**
 * Package containing the service
 * layer classes and interfaces for the application.
 *
 * <p>
 *   This package defines the service
 *   layer which encapsulates the business logic
 *   of the application. It provides interfaces and classes that handle data
 *   processing, validation, and coordination between different parts of the
 *   application, specifically between controllers and repositories.
 *   Key components include:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li><em>UserService</em>: Interface and
 *     implementation for services related to user
 *          management and user operations.</li>
 *     <li><em>NewsService</em>: Interface and
 *     implementation for services related to news
 *          item management.</li>
 *     <li><em>CommunityService</em>: Interface and
 *     implementation for services related to
 *          community management.</li>
 *      <li><em>CommentsService</em>: Interface and
 *      implementation for services related to
 *          comment management.</li>
 *      <li><em>UserCommunityService</em>: Interface and
 *      implementation for services related to
 *          user and community relationships.</li>
 *     <li><em>Other Service Interfaces and Classes</em>:
 *     If you have other service
 *        interfaces or classes, document them using the same format.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  Service classes typically contain the core
 *  business logic of the application and
 *  often rely on dependency injection to access
 *  repository interfaces and other services.
 *  They may also handle transaction management
 *  and additional logic related to specific
 *  use cases.
 * </p>
